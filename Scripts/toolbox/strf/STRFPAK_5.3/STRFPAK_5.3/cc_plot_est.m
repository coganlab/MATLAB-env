% The function returns correlation coefficient square (r^2) between spike1

% function [cc_best, cc_constant, corrval, filterwidth] = cc_plot_est(
%          spike1, spike2, widthvector, widthconstant, smoothflag)
%   -- Calculate best correlation coefficients (cc), constant cc and cc
%   -- Find optimal filterwidth
%   Input:
%        spike1 -- first signal - usually a prediction or a psth
%        spike2 -- second signal - usually a prediction or a psth
%        widthvector -- provide filter width ranges
%        widthconstant -- constant width (default is 21)
%        smoothflag -- flag to smooth filter
%   Output:
%        cc_best -- best cc from given filter wide range
%        cc_constant -- constant cc with given constant filter width
%        filterwidth -- best filter width
