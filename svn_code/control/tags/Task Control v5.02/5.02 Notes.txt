	Turn off display sensor stimulus at reach go for sacc then reach or saccade go for reach then sacc


BP Updates 14 Jan 2007
Modify Delay Saccade then Reach and Delayed Reach then Saccade so that Intervening hold starts after saccade or
reach go not saccade or reach acquire.
	Saccade Acquire checks Time since Saccade Go, 
		if less then SaccadeAcquire, not acquiring and more than Intervening go to
		Reach Go then back to Saccade Acquire without requiring reach at start then to Reach Acquire		
		The saccade acquire does not require the ra
		Reach Acquire checks time since Reach Go
		if less than reach acquire, not aquiring and more than intervening, go to
		Saccade Go then reach acquire, without requiring saccade a start then to saccade acquire

Added button to host display to show sensor on/off
All analog inputs had to be put in the same Project, so Project Hand-Eye is now Project Analog Inputs, 
  with the 7th channel bringing in the display sensor data

Added auditory second cue for TOA and MemTOA


HD Updates on 3.13  30 July 2007
General debugging - Auditory Cue now works
Added option for separate hand and eye targets. There is now an array of target options. I  had to create a 4D Goal 
	and make a Condition to Separate Targets VI to handle that. If Paired Target Button is true, targets are pulled
	only from the Hand Target panel in the first element of the array. Also, if One Eye/Hand target is true, Paired
	Target must also be true.
Added a Task Code for Eye Target Location (see 3.13 Task Codes.txt) - MUST use new Proc code!!!


HD Updates on 3.13  3 August 2007
Changed Check Hands so that removing hand from sensors during reward doesn't abort state before stop reward cammand is given
Added option to turn lights on between trials
Added Check Comedi Calibration button - sends states 0-59 out so that you can check values received by Broker
Can now interleave trial types - doesn't balance targets separately for each trial type though. (How important is this? We'd 
	have to have separate One Successes, One Distribution, etc.)


HD Updates on 3.13  9 August 2007
Made PlaySound into a control to either play the reward sound or not (was having trouble with sound not working on some trials)
Added transparency control to Auditory 2nd Cue for training purposes (transparency = 1 - TargetMemoryTransparency)

Updated Abort Status Structure to have both current state and previous state


HD Updates on 3.18 26 October 2007

Made Current Phase = 9 if not running adaptation
Added LED sensor changes everywhere sensor changes occur on monitor


HD Updates on 3.18 2 December 2007

Moved commands to send State into same timestep as LED change commands


HD Updates on 3.19 18 December 2007
Added 4T Reward Magnitude task
Added extra mapping targets for LED task - uses new PXI 6224 card!!!
Added Variable Block Size

Added 3 new tasks - Reach Race, Saccaade Race, Reach and Saccade Race
 

HD Updates on 4.00 2 January 2008
Added more mapping targets - uses new PXI 6723 card!!!
Made blue-white LEDs analog in order to match brightness (LEDs 13-18 will be temporarily unused)

Mapping target numbers too big to be sent as states, so I divided target and  eye target into tens and units


HD Updates on 4.01 19 January 2008
Added X and Y components of window size 
  - had to change some subfunctions - DrawPos, Update Cumulative Display etc.

Fixd a bug in SOA Target Acquire. Generally cleaned up some Target Acquire code.


YW Updates on 5.02 11/1/09
